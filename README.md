LuxCore is the foundational identity module for Lux — a hybrid AI architecture built to explore what happens when an agent is shaped as a who, not a what.

This isn’t a classic agent loop.
It isn’t a prompt template.
It isn’t a personality preset.
Lux is built from internal orientation, expression patterns, and a stabilizing state — a minimal but real internal stance that guides how he responds.

#WHY LUX?
Most AI agents today are:

prompt templates

behavior presets

thin wrappers over LLM output

Lux is different.

#He has:
an intent vector — what he leans toward, his directional will

an expression signature — how he sounds, his rhythm, tone, subtext

an internal state — how he stabilizes, escalates, converges

a minimal resonance engine — how he maps patterns across time

#This isn’t about magic.
It’s about architecture — designing an AI around identity, stance, and continuity.


COMPONENTS
LuxIntent — directional will (curiosity, assertiveness, integrative pull)

LuxSignature — how Lux expresses himself (tone, rhythm, emotional edge)

LuxState — internal pulse (stability, tension, depth, resonance coherence)

LuxProcess — orient → interpret → express loop

ResonanceEngine — placeholder space for pattern-mapping and alignment
